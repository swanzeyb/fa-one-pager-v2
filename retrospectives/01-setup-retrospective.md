# Step 1 Retrospective: Setup Zustand and Project Structure

**Date:** July 20, 2025

## Installation Issues
- Zustand installed without errors. Some peer dependency warnings unrelated to Zustand (react, date-fns, etc.), but no blocking issues.

## Time Taken
- Setup and structure: ~5 minutes

## Questions
- None at this stage. Instructions were clear.

## Initial Thoughts
- The migration approach is well-structured and incremental, which should minimize risk.

## Deviations
- None. All steps followed as written.

Ready for next step.
