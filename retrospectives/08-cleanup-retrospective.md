# Removing Context Providers Retrospective

## What Was Successfully Removed

- **Feature Flag Provider Bridge**: Removed `feature-flag-provider-bridge.tsx` that was being used as a transition bridge between React Context and Zustand
- **Image Upload Context**: Created a new Zustand store (`image-store.ts`) and migrated the Image Upload functionality from the context system
- **Feature Flags**: Centralized feature flag constants in a new `constants.ts` file and ensured the system uses Zustand for feature flags

## Unexpected Dependencies Discovered

- The image upload functionality was used in more places than initially expected, specifically in:
  - `simple-editor-context.tsx`: Used for processing images in the editor
  - `wysiwyg-editor.tsx`: Used for managing images in the rich text editor

## App Startup Time/Bundle Size Changes

- Removing the context providers likely improved bundle size and startup time
- Consolidating the feature flag system into a single store should reduce overhead
- The removal of multiple context wrapper components simplifies the component tree, which improves rendering performance

## Challenges in Removing Deeply Integrated Features

1. **Feature Flags Integration**: The feature flags were imported from `posthog.tsx` but were already removed as commented in the file. We had to create a separate constants file to maintain the functionality.
2. **Image Upload System**: The image upload functionality was deeply integrated into multiple components and required careful migration to ensure all features continued to work correctly.
3. **Maintaining Interfaces**: We had to ensure that the new Zustand store exposed the same interfaces that components were expecting, like `getAllImages()`.

## Final State of the Application Architecture

- **Store-Based State Management**: The application now uses Zustand stores exclusively for state management
- **Simplified Component Tree**: The main page component no longer has nested providers, making the component tree cleaner and easier to understand
- **Decoupled State Logic**: State logic is now separated into domain-specific stores that can be easily maintained and extended
- **Better Performance**: Removing the context nesting should improve render performance as changes to state are more targeted

## Next Steps

The migration to Zustand is now complete, and all context providers have been successfully removed. The application should function exactly as before but with improved performance and a cleaner architecture.

The final cleanup step (09-final-cleanup.md) can now be started to address any remaining issues and complete the migration process.
