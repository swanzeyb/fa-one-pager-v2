# Stage 9: Testing and Cleanup

## Overview

Test the complete Firebase AI Logic migration, remove old code, clean up unused dependencies, and ensure everything works perfectly.

## Pre-Conditions

- [ ] Stages 1-8 complete (Full Firebase AI Logic implementation)
- [ ] App is working locally with Firebase AI Logic
- [ ] You understand which files can be safely removed
- [ ] You have tested the main AI functionality

## Time Estimate

60 minutes

## Risk Level

Low - Testing and cleanup (but important for final verification)

## Goals

- Thoroughly test all AI functionality
- Remove old server actions and unused code
- Clean up dependencies that are no longer needed
- Verify performance and functionality
- Update documentation

## Tasks

### Task 1: Complete Functionality Testing

Test all AI features systematically:

#### A. File Upload and Processing Test

1. Upload different file types (if your app supports multiple)
2. Test with small and large files
3. Test with multiple files at once
4. Verify AI processing works for all output types:
   - Short Summary
   - Medium Summary
   - How To Guide

#### B. Document Generation Test

1. Generate DOCX documents and verify they download correctly
2. Generate PDF documents and verify they download correctly
3. Test with different content types (headers, lists, paragraphs)
4. Verify generated documents open correctly in their respective applications

#### C. Error Handling Test

1. Test with invalid files
2. Test with network disconnection (to test offline behavior)
3. Test with malformed data
4. Verify error messages are user-friendly

#### D. Performance Test

1. Test processing speed compared to old server actions
2. Test with multiple concurrent operations
3. Monitor browser memory usage during processing
4. Test App Check token refresh

### Task 2: Remove Old Server Actions

Remove the old server actions file:

```bash
# First, backup the old file (optional but recommended)
cp app/actions.ts app/actions.ts.backup

# Remove the old server actions file
rm app/actions.ts
```

### Task 3: Clean Up Dependencies

Update `package.json` to remove unused dependencies:

Since we removed `@ai-sdk/google` and `ai` in Stage 2, verify they're gone:

```bash
# Check what AI-related packages are still installed
npm list | grep -E "(ai|google|vertex)"
```

The only AI-related package should be `firebase`.

### Task 4: Update Imports and Remove Unused Code

Check for any remaining imports from the old actions file:

```bash
# Find any remaining imports from the old actions file
grep -r "from.*actions" . --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --exclude-dir=node_modules
```

If you find any, update them to use the new client-side functions.

### Task 5: Update Services Index

Clean up `services/index.ts` to remove references to old server-side implementations:

```typescript
// Clean services exports - remove any server-side specific exports
export * from './firebase-ai-service'
export * from './analytics-service'
export * from './file-service'

// Remove or update ai-service export if it's not needed anymore
// since firebase-ai-service now handles everything
```

You can also remove `services/ai-service.ts` if it's no longer needed, since `firebase-ai-service.ts` handles all the functionality.

### Task 6: Performance Verification

Create a simple performance test to compare the new implementation:

Create `test-performance.ts` (temporary file for testing):

```typescript
// Performance test - create temporarily, delete after testing
'use client'

import { processOutput } from '@/app/client-actions'
import type { FileAttachment, OutputType } from '@/app/actions'

// Test function to measure performance
export async function testPerformance() {
  const testFile: FileAttachment = {
    name: 'test.txt',
    contentType: 'text/plain',
    data:
      'data:text/plain;base64,' +
      btoa('This is a test document for performance testing.'),
  }

  const startTime = performance.now()

  try {
    const result = await processOutput([testFile], 'shortSummary')
    const endTime = performance.now()

    console.log(`Processing took ${endTime - startTime} milliseconds`)
    console.log('Result length:', result.length)

    return {
      duration: endTime - startTime,
      success: true,
      resultLength: result.length,
    }
  } catch (error) {
    const endTime = performance.now()
    console.error('Performance test failed:', error)

    return {
      duration: endTime - startTime,
      success: false,
      error: error.message,
    }
  }
}
```

Run this test in your browser console, then delete the file.

### Task 7: Final Build and Deploy Test

Test the complete build process:

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf .next
npm run build

# Test the production build locally
npm run start
```

Navigate through your app and test all AI features in the production build.

### Task 8: Update Documentation

Update your `README.md` to reflect the new Firebase AI Logic implementation:

Add this section to your README:

````markdown
## AI Processing

This application uses Firebase AI Logic for client-side AI processing:

- **AI Model**: Gemini Pro via Firebase AI Logic
- **Processing**: Client-side (no backend required)
- **Security**: Protected by Firebase App Check
- **Features**:
  - Document summarization (short, medium)
  - How-to guide generation
  - DOCX and PDF document export

### Setup

1. Set up Firebase project with AI Logic enabled
2. Configure environment variables (see `.env.example`)
3. Set up Firebase App Check with reCAPTCHA v3
4. Deploy with proper environment configuration

See `docs/firebase-setup.md` for detailed setup instructions.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```
````

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Make sure to set all required environment variables in your hosting platform.
