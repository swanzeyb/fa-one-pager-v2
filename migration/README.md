# Firebase AI Logic Migration - Complete Guide

## Overview

This directory contains a complete 9-stage migration plan to migrate your Next.js application from server-side Google AI SDK to client-side Firebase AI Logic.

## Migration Stages

Each stage is designed to be small and manageable for a junior developer, with clear pre and post conditions.

### Stage 1: Set up Firebase Configuration

**Time**: 30 minutes | **Risk**: Low

- Create Firebase configuration files
- Set up environment variables
- Initialize basic Firebase connection

### Stage 2: Install Firebase AI Logic Dependencies

**Time**: 15 minutes | **Risk**: Low

- Update package.json dependencies
- Remove old AI SDK packages
- Install Firebase AI Logic

### Stage 3: Create Firebase AI Service

**Time**: 45 minutes | **Risk**: Medium

- Build new AI service using Firebase AI Logic
- Implement client-side AI processing
- Add error handling and retry logic

### Stage 4: Set up App Check Security

**Time**: 30 minutes | **Risk**: Medium

- Configure Firebase App Check
- Set up reCAPTCHA v3 protection
- Secure AI Logic calls

### Stage 5: Update AI Service Interface

**Time**: 60 minutes | **Risk**: Medium

- Modify existing AI service to use Firebase
- Load prompts on client-side
- Maintain existing function signatures

### Stage 6: Update Actions to Use Client-Side AI

**Time**: 90 minutes | **Risk**: High

- Create client-side versions of server actions
- Implement browser-based document generation
- Build client-side AI processing hooks

### Stage 7: Update Components and Hooks

**Time**: 60 minutes | **Risk**: Medium

- Update UI components to use client-side AI
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Connect components to Firebase AI Logic

### Stage 8: Environment and Configuration

**Time**: 45 minutes | **Risk**: Low

- Set up production-ready configuration
- Document deployment process
- Configure security for production

### Stage 9: Testing and Cleanup

**Time**: 60 minutes | **Risk**: Low

- Test all functionality thoroughly
- Remove old server actions and unused code
- Clean up dependencies and documentation

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Firebase project created
   - Firebase AI Logic enabled
   - Basic understanding of TypeScript/React

2. **Start with Stage 1**:

   ```bash
   cd migration
   cat stage-01-firebase-config.md
   ```

3. **Follow each stage in order**:
   - Read the entire stage before starting
   - Check all pre-conditions
   - Complete all tasks
   - Verify all post-conditions
   - Only move to next stage when current stage is 100% complete

## Architecture Changes

### Before Migration

```
Browser → Next.js Server Actions → Google AI SDK → Gemini API
```

### After Migration

```
Browser → Firebase AI Logic → Gemini API
```

## Benefits of Migration

- ✅ **No backend required** - AI processing in browser
- ✅ **Better security** - Firebase App Check protection
- ✅ **Improved performance** - Direct client-to-Gemini
- ✅ **Reduced costs** - No server infrastructure for AI
- ✅ **Better scalability** - Scales with users, not servers
- ✅ **Real-time capabilities** - Streaming support available

## Files Created During Migration

### New Files

- `lib/firebase.ts` - Firebase initialization
- `lib/app-check.ts` - Security configuration
- `lib/prompts.ts` - Client-side prompt loading
- `services/firebase-ai-service.ts` - Firebase AI Logic service
- `app/client-actions.ts` - Client-side AI actions
- `hooks/use-client-ai.ts` - React hook for AI operations
- `docs/firebase-setup.md` - Setup documentation
- `docs/deployment-checklist.md` - Deployment guide

### Updated Files

- `services/ai-service.ts` - Uses Firebase internally
- Components using AI functionality
- `package.json` - Updated dependencies
- Environment variable files

### Removed Files

- `app/actions.ts` - Old server actions (removed in Stage 9)

## Team Workflow

### For Junior Developers

- Follow stages sequentially
- Don't skip pre-condition checks
- Test thoroughly at each stage
- Ask for help if any post-conditions fail

### For Senior Developers

- Review work at end of each stage
- Help with troubleshooting if needed
- Verify security configuration in Stages 4 & 8
- Review final testing in Stage 9

### For DevOps/Deployment

- Focus on Stages 1, 8, and 9
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Firebase project configuration
- Test production deployment

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Firebase AI Logic not enabled"

- Check Firebase Console → Project Settings → Integrations
- Enable "Firebase AI Logic" (Vertex AI in Firebase)

### "App Check initialization failed"

- Verify reCAPTCHA site key is correct
- Check that App Check is enabled in Firebase Console
- Make sure domain is authorized

### "Module not found" errors

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check that file paths are correct
- Verify TypeScript configuration

### Components not updating

- Make sure components are marked as client components (`'use client'`)
- Check that hooks are called inside React components
- Verify state updates are happening correctly

## Support and Documentation

- Each stage has detailed troubleshooting section
- Check Firebase Console for service status
- Review browser console for client-side errors
- Test in production mode before deployment

## Success Criteria

The migration is successful when:

- [ ] All AI features work without server actions
- [ ] Document generation works in browser
- [ ] Firebase App Check protects AI calls
- [ ] Performance is same or better than before
- [ ] Team can develop and deploy successfully
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
