/*
File Handling:
As a user, I can interact with a file input element to open my system's file browser.
As a user, I can select a file (e.g., PDF, DOCX, PNG) using the file input.
As a user, I can drop a file onto a designated drop zone element.
As a user, upon selecting or dropping a file, its name appears in a designated file list area.
As a user, I can click a 'remove' button associated with a file in the list, and that file name disappears from the list.
As a user, while files are uploading/processing, a visual loading indicator (e.g., spinner, progress bar) is displayed.
As a user, upon successful upload/processing, the loading indicator is removed.
As a user, if an upload error occurs, an error message is displayed (e.g., in a toast notification or near the upload area).
